There were   flight back to Cochin on the 2nd of March, so I                a lot of monkeys on the way up and somehow,   decided to make the most out of the two  days i                we all reached the top. I couldn’t believe my   has left. With my peace lover group, we started                                           30       IL L UME  '20","to explore Kuala Lumpur and China town. We                have Malaysian local food. It tasted good, but                it was really sweet for me because they rarely                used spices in their dishes but still the food                was really nice. We walked through paddling                streets and we enjoyed going around that day.                 March 1st, i started to count my last few hours                in Malaysia, i got a call from mom, full of love,                saying that she was waiting for me to return                home and few of her friends called me too, and                gave me the list of things they needed me to                bring back. Me and Adduka spent the whole                day purchasing everything we needed, and                we bought chocolates for our tutors, friends,                and family. For the last I went to time square                after the heavy purchase, and I spent all my                remaining money from my internship and                work buying stuff for my loved ones back                home. In the end, we’ll always have to go back                home.                 March 2nd, the last day, I took a nice nap,                packed my bag and took a great last dip in the                infinity pool. After one last visit to the twin                towers and after having Malaysian local food,                I left my room at 3 and went to the airport.                It was raining heavily during my trip to the                airport. After a good look back, I went through                with the security checking process and entered                the flight. The flight was half occupied, so I had                three seats to myself. At 10 in the morning,                I reached Ernakulam and took an uber to                the station, from where I took a train to my                hometown, Trikaripur, Kasaragod district, in                GOD’S OWN COUNTRY.                 \"I’m in love with cities I’ve never been to \&                people I’ve never met\"                                                                                                          31                                                                   IL L UME  '20","HAPPINESS!
